Starting from the high school, the students escape into town where they must deal with a corrupt teacher and his students. They check their homes for survivors, and pick up a little girl and a dog. Later, they hold up at a mall, travel through a police station, and eventually make their way to an elementary school that is supposedly a safe zone." -Wikipedia</p></td></tr>

Strangely, Yuki's new diary has entries in it spanning the next 90 days\[LongDash]entries about the future that come unnervingly true. Deus, revealed to be the not-so-imaginary God of Time and Space, then forces Yuki to participate in a battle royale with eleven other people, each of whom also has a diary that can predict the future in some unique way. The rules of this "Survival Game" are simple: the contestants must try to find and kill all the other contestants before the world ends on Day 90, and only the last one standing can prevent the Apocalypse and become the new God of Time and Space. Yuki initially has no desire to win the game, but after Deus informs the other contestants that Yuki, as the "1st" Diary owner, is his favorite to win the game, he is forced to team up with the 2nd Diary owner\[LongDash]his obsessive stalker and lover, Yuno Gasai\[LongDash]in order to survive the constant attempts on his life by the other diary users, who see him as the biggest threat." -Wikipedia</p></td></tr>
