As the empire grew and expanded along the eastern isles, the queen of Britannia was laid to rest at the apparent hand of an enemy assassin and leaving the queen's daughter, Nunnally, permanently disabled and blind. Lelouch, the prince of Britannia at the time, and his sister were both exiled at a young age when Lelouch accused his father, the king, of failing to protect his mother. He and his sister were then used as political hostages in agreements between the then-sovereign Japanese and the Britannian empire. This thin political veil was shattered, however, when Britannia invaded and took control of Japan, leaving Lelouch in the company of fargone family friends in Japan and forcing him to keep his royalty a secret As Lelouch matured into his teens, he lived a relatively normal life, albeit one graced with his unnaturally high intelligence. The discovery of an experimental prisoner, however, grants Lelouch an ancient gift utilized by nobility past: the geass. This grants him the power of suggestion, controlling the minds of any he stares into the eyes of. With his newfound power, Lelouch embarks on a rebellion against the Monarchy and attempts to overthrow the Britannian government in Japan.</p></td></tr>

So our protagonist named Yuki is fighting for his life, and a fellow contestant, his stalker/lover Yuno helps him. This is the series that defined the Yandere genre. An adorable girl who is obsessively in love, and will become violent at the mere mention of competition. This series was pretty great, in my opinion. Good plot, well rounded characters, and subplots that were as good as the main. Yuno is really a seller, many people have a strong opinion on her, either as a psycho who they hope dies as soon as possible, or a cute, misunderstood girl who just needs some love. Regardless watch it.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_%2B_Vampire"><image src="http://bumshopvn.com/wp-content/uploads/rosario-vampire.jpg"/></a></td><td>Rosario + Vampire/Rozario to Banpaia<p>This anime is good fun, with each girl in the monster harem embodying a different trope. You've got the child genius, the all around good and adorable girl/secret badass, the dandere (cool and emotionless with a lovey side), and the big boobies. The worst character of all is perhaps our protagonist, who is stupid, weak, and a major pervert. Not too uncommon in anime protagonists. While the plot is rather bland at times, the episode of the week format may not satisfy everyone, and the short drastically unmatched battles leave very little plot, it's actually a decent filler anime. Good for the casual watcher.</p></td></tr>

Beautifully drawn, and with a fun and dare I say slightly educational plot, this anime is a fairly rare gem that will appeal more to a dedicated watcher than a casual viewer, and whose endearing characters can be enjoyed by a wide variety of viewers. Unlike many series on this list, I was unashamed to share this series with my family, including my young brother, as the only objectionable content is barbie-doll style nudity which occurs periodically throughout. </p></td></tr>

Captured and bound soon after, Ciel cried out to the void, pleading for vengeance against those with his family blood on their hands. The void answered, and a demon emerged to make a pact with the child: Ciel will be aided by the demon in granting his wish of vengeance, but is to give his soul to the demon. Now the two embark on a crime-thwarting spree about London to bring retribution to those that took everything from Criel.</p></td></tr>

For its genre it's very innocent, and depicts the couples growing together in the best way. Fans may feel like saying "Just kiss already!" at many points in the anime, however the fact it does not over service the fans is actually a rather nice point, and because of this the characters and their relationships are able to be well developed. In addition this creates proper tension in the series. Very nice for the romance fan.</p></td></tr>

Along the way we meet Shiro, a mysterious albino girl, among other mysterious Deadmen. The anime was good, but left out some of the most dynamic characters and plotlines from the manga, leaving viewers with questions and no answers, as the series will not get a second season.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantz"><image src="http://www.at-x.com/images/program/gantz_2.jpg"/></a></td><td>Gantz/Gantsu<p>Gantz is perfect for fans of death games, such as the Hunger Games, Battle Royale, Future Diary, etc. Sometimes you just want an anime with girls, guns, and aliens, and gore, despite its serious tone at times, Gantz provides that in what, for me, became something of a guilty pleasure. Just binge a few episodes of this and you'll either find yourself cringing, or loving it. The anime is rather mediocre compared to the manga, however, so for the real plot, it is better to go towards manga than anime. For mindless fun/death, just watch the anime.</p></td></tr>

As dumb as the premise might sound, this anime analyzes a lot of questions, including what makes humans different from other animals, or more worthy of life than the animals they consume. It is also notable for a crisp animation style, and unique premise.</p></td></tr>

This is an anime about the consequences of wishes, and a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. This anime has solid character and plot development, a unique animation style, and some witch hunting sequences that have convinced me to always do LSD. Overall, the thematic message of the anime is every wish you make causes pain to someone else. At the very least it's entertaining, and for that it deserves to be watched by any hardcore anime fan.</p></td></tr>

He uses it to execute criminals in hopes of becoming a bringing justice to the world. L is a brilliant detective, who trails Light in the cat and mouse game of the century. The series is great, until suddenly it's not. No spoilers, but the quality of the plot dies along with one of the main characters. Too much spoiler? Too bad. Lots of people die. </p></td></tr>

IT is an anime that can be summarized as guns, zombies, hot girls, and boobies. While the plot is mediocre, the action scenes are very well executed, and watching the badass fight scenes was just so. Much. Fun. Probably worth noting that the physics of the show suck... but... who really cares?</p></td></tr>
