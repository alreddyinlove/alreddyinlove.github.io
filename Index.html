Although I say the following with humor - it is a question you really need to consider -

When gaming seriously, you need to decide - is this a gaming rig or a fashion accessory?
Is your PC ready for action at a moments notice? Can it be booted and ready for action in under a minute?
Can you jump on the internet, start writing a book, or fly right into a game immediately?

OR is this more accurate -

You prefer your PC to look pretty, be all colorful with a slide show of random images, you have 12 seperate antivirus and malware tools installed, none of which you know how to use, some silly cartoon character pops up anytime someone comments on twitter, emails you, or posts to facebook - when new shoes or a rolex go on sale; the latest gossip happens or a multitude of other stupid things a popup jumps on screen telling you?

If you said yes to the preference for pretty, I suggest you sell your PC, and buy a smart phone or tablet - this guide isn't really for you. Buying the latest "fashion" in smart phones would give you more satisfaction. No really..
